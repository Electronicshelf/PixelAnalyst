\chapter{Micro-LED Future Technology}
\section{Advantages Over OLED}
\begin{itemize}
\item No burn-in (inorganic)
\item Higher brightness (>10,000 nits)
\item Longer lifetime (100,000+ hours)
\item Better efficiency
\item Wider temperature range
\end{itemize}

\section{Mass Transfer Yield Challenge}
\begin{formulabox}{Panel Yield Sensitivity}
If each subpixel transfer has success probability $p$ and the panel requires $N$ subpixels:
\begin{equation}
Y_{\text{panel}} = p^N
\end{equation}
For a 4K RGB panel, $N \approx 3 \times 3840 \times 2160 = 24{,}883{,}200$.
\end{formulabox}

\begin{importantbox}{Manufacturing Implication}
Even very high single-transfer yield can produce near-zero full-panel yield without redundancy and laser repair. This is why transfer, inspection, and repair tooling define micro-LED cost more than emitter physics alone.
