\chapter{Color Matching Functions}

The CIE 1931 2-degree color matching functions $\bar{x}(\lambda)$, $\bar{y}(\lambda)$, and $\bar{z}(\lambda)$ define the linear transform from spectra to XYZ tristimulus values. In practice:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\bar{y}(\lambda)$ is aligned with photopic luminance sensitivity.
  \item Numerical integration is usually implemented as a weighted sum over sampled wavelengths.
  \item 10-degree observer data can be preferable for wide-field stimuli.
\end{itemize}
